    "A picture is worth a thousand words. Good visualizations speak for themselves saving the expensive stakeholders' time while presenting a data project. Unfortunately, raw data exploration plots are not suitable for sharing with audience no matter how good the visualization library is. The visualizations require fine tuning to make them easy to navigate for an untrained eye. Otherwise, a large chunk of the meeting is wasted on explaining what is on the plot rather than talking about the implications. Though tempting, such tradeoff can push a decision on a critical project by weeks or months.\n",

    "<a href=\"https://seaborn.pydata.org/\">Seaborn</a>, <a href=\"https://plotly.com/\">Plotly</a>, <a href=\"https://altair-viz.github.io/\">Altair</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pygal.org\">Pygal</a>, and <a href=\"https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/\">Plotnine</a> are among the many others. The libraries compete in how much insights they can cram in one graph with a single `plot` command. This helps tremendously in data exploration and discussing intermediate results with fellow data scientists. However, the business stakeholders get confused with the complexity of such elaborate visualizations especially if presented in a raw form. They did not read the dataset documentation to guess that **cty** on x axis is the fuel consumption in the city, may not be aware of the average for the industry to compare it with, or did not have a training about where to look at in a box plot. It is on us to make the graphs easy to read. I data professional is responsible for focusing stakeholders' attention on the things they want to know. This last mile from a flashy picture to an informative graph requires a significant effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say, I found a function from a new visualization library that fits perfectly to my data and renders the following plot that I found in <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jordan.johnson_35348/is-ruby-on-rails-on-the-next-train-out-cc580d9d0f14\">this article</a>:\n",

Even after that, it is unclear what message I want to get across and where to look for justification. Each mental step that a stakeholder has to take while reading the plot increases the chances of misinterpretation and the overall confusion. Such simple steps as adding an x label or writing a title do the job but get often omitted. Memorizing the corresponding commands for each new library or googling the documentation every time is not impossible but tedious. Instead, I want concentrate on the tricks that cover the last mile using the standard `matplotlib` library. There are two reasons for that:\n",
