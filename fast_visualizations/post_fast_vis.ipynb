Though tempting, such tradeoff can push a decision on a critical project by weeks or months.\n",

    "I get very excited reading about their capabilities. However, the resulting plot still needs fine tuning no matter how sophisticated the visualization function is. This last mile from a flashy picture to an informative graph requires the most effort. Say, I found a function from a fancy library that fits perfectly to my data and renders the following plot that I saw in <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jordan.johnson_35348/is-ruby-on-rails-on-the-next-train-out-cc580d9d0f14\">this article</a>:\n",

Adding and x label or writing a title is typically possible but require a dive into documentation of that specific library. Next time when the data fit better to a function from a different library I will have to dive again. Not impossible but tedious.\n",

    "  </li>\n",
    "  <li> <b>Sufficiency</b>. The standard plotting library provides the majority of the required functionality. The result might not be as flashy or interactive but has all the means for bringing the point across efficiently. For example, the above visualization can be delivered with the standard library in the way shown below.\n",
