# Convert PySpark notebook to production code
## Motivation
The gap between a working notebook and a maintainable production code is significant especially in teams where everyone specializes on a separate part of the project lifecycle.
The cases where an analyst or a data scientist throws a proof of concept notebook for productionalization are common.
This disconnect creates solutions that are hard to maintain and modify if needed.
Even the code creators forget what they meant with certain lines of code and have to rewrite things from scratch once requirements change.
Moreover, the same pieces of code keep being rewritten over and over causing longer development cycles and higher chances of errors.
